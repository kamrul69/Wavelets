# Wavelets
Wavelet was discovered in the eighteenth century. It was introduced to generalize the Fourier one and to overcome the disadvantages of Fourier
analysis.You know Fourier transform is not suitable for studying the local behaviour of signal. On the other hand, wavelets transform is really suitable
for studying the local behavior of signal.

Wavelet analysis requires two basic functions which are Scaling function and details function. A wavelet system is the infinite collection of translated and scaled version of father wavelet and mother wavelet. 

Waveles is used for non-homogenous function such as Doppler function. It is really a great tool for analysing the local behavior of signal. One comparision could help us to understand why it is a great tool. If 100 data points are drawn and local linear smoother is used for different bandwidths, the plots are shown for different bandwidth. Plots of large bandwidths show the smooth function, but plots with small bandwidth show non-smooth function. Here problem is that we are getting smooth function also, but we are missing local information i.e. local behaviour of our signal. 

Here is the point! Our target is to get not only the smooth function but also ensuring the local informaion. Wavelets can ensure both points. By increasing multi-resolution, wavelets help to get more localized function which is the main goal of us.
